Good to meet you!

This page serves as a personal homepage where I can publish some content as well as some information about my personal [ASN](https://rvdm.net/bgp).

The rvdm.net domain name comes from the letters of my name - I'm Robert van der Meulen, and more info on what I do professionally can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertvandermeulen/) page. This website is a personal thing, so any and all opinions and content here are my own, and not related to my work.

Outside my work there's some things I'm interested in; most of them related to technology. I love to play around with computers and the internet and tinker with code or electronics. Like many people with these hobbies I'm interested in home automation - and you can find a, probably outdated, overview of how I run my setup [here](https://github.com/rvdm/home-assistant). 

My operating system of choice is linux (on servers) and macOS on clients. I like automation, so most of my machines are setup using a very simple [ansible setup](https://github.com/rvdm/ansible) combined with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for my dotfiles (those can be found [here](https://github.com/rvdm/dotfiles)).

On the less technological side of things I like to spend time outside, travel, and have a pilot's license that I try to use as often as I can. Eventually there might be some posts on here on building an [RV-14](https://www.vansaircraft.com/rv-14/) airplane, but that's mostly a dream at the moment :smiley:

Should you want to get in touch with me, the [about](https://rvdm.net/) page doesn't have a lot of info. I guess if you need to contact me, there's enough information around this page to do that. If you're an IRC person, I can be found under the nickname 'rvdm' on some popular networks (but mostly IRCNET).
