# Welcome to rvdm.net

Hi!

This site serves as my personal little space to eventually post a little bit about stuff I'm working on or thinking about. You can learn more about me in the [about](https://rvdm.net/about/) page, or just browse around here. If you need to contact me, I'm sure you'll find a way :smiley:

Specifically, if you're interested to learn about what I'm doing with BGP, take a look [here](https://rvdm.net/bgp/). 

The [posts](https://rvdm.net/posts/) page should eventually have some blog updates.
